# `Day 84 - Advanced`

## Objective:

```
- Using what you have learnt about Python programming, you will build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game. 
- The game should be playable in the command line just like the Blackjack game we created on Day 11. 
- It should be a 2-player game, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O".
```
