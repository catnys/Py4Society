## Getting Started with Bootstrap

To start using Bootstrap, you can either download it from the official website or include it directly in your project
using a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

### Including Bootstrap via CDN

Include the following links in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```
<!-- CSS --> <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<!-- JS, Popper.js, and jQuery --> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.3/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

### Starting a Project

Create an HTML file and include the Bootstrap CDN links as shown above. Then, you can start building your project using
Bootstrap classes and components.

Example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en">
   <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
      <!-- Bootstrap CSS --> 
      <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
   </head>
   <body>
      <div class="container">
         <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
         <p>This is a simple example of a Bootstrap page.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- Optional JavaScript --> <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS --> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.3/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> 
   </body>
</html>
```
