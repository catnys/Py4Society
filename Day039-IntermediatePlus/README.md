# `Day 39 - Intermediate+`

# Capstone Project Part 1: Flight Deal Finder

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple flight reservation system using Python. It covers fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and practical applications such as date formatting and class definitions.

## Overview

The core component of this system is the `Flight` class, which models a flight reservation. The class includes attributes for origin and destination location codes, departure and return dates, passenger counts, travel class, currency, and maximum price. It also incorporates methods for validating date formats and formatting dates according to the ISO 8601 standard.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and objects to represent real-world entities (flights) and their properties.
- **Date Formatting**: Implements methods for formatting and validating dates, ensuring consistency and correctness in date representations.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling mechanisms to validate input parameters and ensure data integrity.
