# `Day 94 - Advanced`


## `Objective` : Automate the Google Dinosaur Game

Playing the Google Dinosaur Game programmatically involves automating keyboard presses to simulate the dinosaur's movements. This can be achieved using Selenium, a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs. Selenium allows us to automate actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, and pressing keys, which are essential for playing the game.

Before starting, ensure you have Selenium installed. If not, you can install it along with WebDriver for Chrome (or Firefox) using pip:
```
pip install selenium
```
