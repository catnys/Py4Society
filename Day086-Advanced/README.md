# `Day 86 - Advanced`

## `Objective`
- Using Tkinter and what you have learnt about building GUI applications with Python, build a desktop app that assesses your typing speed. 
- Give the user some sample text and detect how many words they can type per minute.
- The average typing speed is 40 words per minute. But with practice, you can speed up to 100 words per minute.
