Web scraping is the process of extracting information from websites. It involves making requests to web pages, downloading the HTML content, parsing it to extract useful information, and then storing or using that information in various ways. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, is a popular choice for web scraping due to its simplicity and efficiency.

## Why Web Scraping?

Web scraping is used for various purposes, including data analysis, competitive research, automating tedious tasks, and much more. It enables businesses and individuals to collect large amounts of data from websites quickly and efficiently.

Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

## Key Libraries for Web Scraping in Python

Several libraries in Python facilitate web scraping. Some of the most commonly used ones include:

- **Requests**: Used for making HTTP requests to download web pages.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees that are helpful to extract the data easily.
- **Selenium**: A powerful tool for controlling a web browser through the program. It's useful for scraping websites that rely heavily on JavaScript.
- **Scrapy**: An open-source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python. It's used for extracting the data from the website, processing it, and storing it in your preferred format.
