# `Day 97 - Advanced`


## `Objective` : Custom API Based Website v2

Key Points Considered:

Choosing an engaging and educational API for the project.
Setting up a Flask environment and creating a basic application structure.
Making HTTP GET requests to external APIs and handling JSON responses.
Dynamically updating web page content based on user actions (e.g., clicking a button) using JavaScript.
Using Python's data structures (lists and dictionaries) to manage and manipulate the data received from the API.

In this project, we've built a simple web application using Flask that interacts with the Food Facts API to fetch and display random food facts. This demonstrates how to set up a basic Flask application, make HTTP requests to external APIs, and dynamically update web pages based on user interaction using Python's data structures.
