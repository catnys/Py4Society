## `Objective` : Custom Web Scraper

Build a custom web scraper to collect data on things that you are interested in.
- For this example, let's scrape data on NBA player stats from a website. We'll use BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries in Python to scrape the data and then save it into a CSV file. 
- Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary permissions to scrape the target website, and always respect the site's robots.txt file and terms of service.


Run the script
```
python NBA_Scrapper.py
```
